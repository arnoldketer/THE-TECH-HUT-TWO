THE TECH HUT TWO

## Project Description

In this project, I'm solving the balanced parenthesis problem.

**Important Note**

A parenthesis is said to be balanced if each left parenthesis has a right parenthesis. 
The parenthesis should be in pairs; otherwise, these are not balanced. 

Here, I'm using stack where I'll push each opening parenthesis in the stack and pop the last inserted opening parenthesis whenever a closing parenthesis is encountered. If the closing parenthesis does not correspond to the opening parenthesis, then we stop and say that the parenthesis are not balanced.

### Getting started
1. Open VS Code: Launch Visual Studio Code on your computer.

2. Open Your Python Script: Open the Python script index.py. You can do this by going to File > Open File to open the specific script.

3. Select Python Interpreter:

    You can choose the interpreter by clicking on the Python version in the bottom status bar 
    To create or modify settings, you can go to File > Preferences > Settings, then search for "Python Path" and set it to the path of your Python interpreter.

4. Run Your Python Script:

    Right-click on the script in the file explorer and select "Run Python File in Terminal" or by opening a terminal in VS Code and running python index.py.


5. Output: You will see the output of your Python script in the terminal window at the bottom of the VS Code interface.
