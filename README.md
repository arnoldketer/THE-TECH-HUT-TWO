THE TECH HUT TWO

## Project Description

In this project, I'm solving the balanced parenthesis problem.
** Important Note **
A parenthesis is said to be balanced if each left parenthesis has a right parenthesis. 
The parenthesis should be in pairs; otherwise, these are not balanced. 

Here, I'm using stack where I'll push each opening parenthesis in the stack and pop the last inserted opening parenthesis whenever a closing parenthesis is encountered. If the closing parenthesis does not correspond to the opening parenthesis, then we stop and say that the parenthesis are not balanced.
